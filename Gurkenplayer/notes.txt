Coop or competitive/independent mode?

COOP:
-stuff to synchronize
->money (current account balance, profit and loss, loan)
->citizens
->area demand
->buildings and streets (and removal of both)
->current speed and time (disable speed options?)
->current and bought tiles
->???

Competitive/Independent mode
-stuff to synchronize
->buildings and streets (and removal of both)
->current speed and time
->???

ToDo for both:
-Create a configuration window at the start of the game
-How to start the multiplayer session? Only new game?



Notes:
ICities.dll -> Official modding API
Assembly-CSharp.dll -> Contains almost all of the gameplay related classes. (Road system, citizens, buildings, chirper, usw)
ColossalFramework.UI -> The UI that is used by the game. Is used to create your own UI component.

Current procedure:
-both start the game with the same world (must have the same mods (or even none)?)
-on level load force stop the game
-open window where you can create a server lobby or connect to a game. (Configuration)
-you have to configure the amount of connections in setup
-open server and wait till its full
-if it is full, show a message on server with 'start game'
-onclick remove force stop of the game
-play
